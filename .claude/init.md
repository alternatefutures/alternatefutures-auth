# Alternate Futures App - Claude Code Initialization

This file contains **mandatory** workflow rules and checklists for working on the Alternate Futures App. These are not suggestions - they are requirements that MUST be followed.

---

## 🚀 SESSION START CHECKLIST

Execute these tasks at the beginning of EVERY session:

### ✅ 1. Load Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify .env file exists and is loaded
cat .env | grep -E "(LINEAR_API_KEY|GITHUB_TOKEN)"
```

**Required environment variables:**
- `LINEAR_API_KEY` - For Linear MCP integration
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For GitHub MCP integration
- Database credentials
- Service endpoints
- Feature flags

**Action if missing:** Copy from `.env.example` and fill in credentials

---

### ✅ 2. Pull Tasks from Linear (via Linear MCP)
```
Use Linear MCP to query current tasks:
- Get all tasks in "In Progress" state
- Get all tasks assigned to current user
- Get next highest priority task in "Todo" state
```

**Required actions:**
- Identify which task(s) are currently being worked on
- Check for any blocked tasks that need attention
- Note the next priority task for after current work completes

---

### ✅ 3. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline -5
```

**Verify:**
- Current branch name follows convention: `feat/alt-{number}-description`
- No uncommitted changes from previous session (should have been committed on exit)
- Branch is synced with remote

**If on `main` branch:**
- Create or switch to a feature branch immediately
- Never work directly on `main`

---

### ✅ 4. Identify Current Linear Issue
From the current branch name (e.g., `feat/alt-25-billing`), identify the related Linear issue:
- Extract issue number (e.g., `ALT-25`)
- Use Linear MCP to fetch issue details
- Verify issue status matches current work state

---

### ✅ 5. Review Recent Activity
```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check recent PRs (via GitHub MCP)
gh pr list --limit 5
```

**Understand:**
- What was completed in last session
- What's currently in review
- Any feedback or comments on PRs

---

## 💻 DURING SESSION - MANDATORY RULES

### 🔴 RULE #1: No Commits Without a Linear Issue

**Before ANY commit:**
1. ✅ Verify a Linear issue exists for the work
2. ✅ If no issue exists → CREATE ONE FIRST using Linear MCP
3. ✅ Assign the issue to the appropriate person (REQUIRED)
4. ✅ Set proper labels and priority

**Never skip this step. Ever.**

---

### 🔴 RULE #2: Branch Naming Convention

**Required format:**
```
{type}/alt-{issue-number}-{short-description}
```

**Types:**
- `feat/` - New feature (e.g., `feat/alt-25-billing-dashboard`)
- `fix/` - Bug fix (e.g., `fix/alt-30-auth-error`)
- `enhance/` - Enhancement (e.g., `enhance/alt-42-ui-polish`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/alt-15-cleanup-stores`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/alt-18-api-docs`)
- `test/` - Tests (e.g., `test/alt-22-agent-tests`)

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feat/alt-25-encoded-message`
- ✅ `fix/alt-30-auth-error`
- ❌ `feature-billing` (no issue number)
- ❌ `alt-25` (no type prefix)

---

### 🔴 RULE #3: Commit Message Format

### 🔴 RULE #5: Linear Task Assignment

**When creating Linear issues via MCP:**

- ✅ Add to proper project/team
- ✅ Link to related issues if applicable

**Never create unassigned issues.**

---

### 🔴 RULE #6: Never Ask "Want to do something else?"

**After completing a task, ALWAYS:**
1. ✅ Use Linear MCP to query next highest priority task
2. ✅ Present the task details to user
3. ✅ Ask if ready to start on THAT SPECIFIC task

**Example response:**
```
✅ Completed ALT-25: Add billing dashboard

I've pushed the changes and updated Linear.

Next task from Linear:
📋 ALT-26: Implement real deployment backend (Priority: High)
Status: Todo
Assigned to: @wonderwomancode
Description: Build backend services for IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave deployments

Ready to start on ALT-26?
```

**NEVER say:**
❌ "What would you like to work on next?"
❌ "Do you want to do something else?"
❌ "Anything else I can help with?"

- Assign tasks to team members
- Query next priority tasks

### GitHub MCP
- Create/update PRs
- Review PR status
- Manage branches
- Check CI/CD status
- Link PRs to Linear issues

**Setup:** See `.claude/mcp-setup.md` for detailed MCP server configuration instructions.
