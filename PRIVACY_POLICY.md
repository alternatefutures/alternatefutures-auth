## Introduction

Alternate Futures Auth Service ("we", "our", "the service") is a **privacy-focused, open-source authentication system**. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and your rights.

**Philosophy**: We believe privacy is a fundamental human right. We collect the absolute minimum data necessary to provide authentication services.
